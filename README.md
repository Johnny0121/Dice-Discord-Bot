# Dice Roll Discord Bot
This repository will contain a very simple discord bot for rolling some dice.
Very useful for Dungeons and Dragons if playing on Discord.

# How to use
1. First, add the Discord bot to your server via this link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=745271412918452285&permissions=8&scope=bot)!
2. That's it! You can roll dice with the following command `/r 2d5 + 5`. This will roll 2 dice of 5 faces, then add 5 to the result.

If you no longer want the bot on your server, just kick the bot off the server and that should be it.
